# SQL-portfolio-projects

The purpose of these projects is for me to get in touch with my SQL skills and build upon them, along with improving my knowledge on Data Analysis and the ETL process.

1. Toyota Inventory:
   Here I'm creating two tables, one for the latest Toyota models and another for the older models. I am performing transformations on the two data sets by performing JOINS.

2. Global Populations:
   I am taking csv data that contains information on the population and growth rate of each country, and making changes to the data according to my interest.
